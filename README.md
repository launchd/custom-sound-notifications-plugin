# Custom Sound Notifications Plugin
An OSRS Runelite plugin that provides sound and chat notifications when a specific game message is received. The user can supply a comma-seperated list of keywords to be used as triggers.

For example, if an alert on a stamina potion was desired, the user could add the word stamina in the configuration. When a chat message appears like "Your stamina enhancement is about to expire," then the user will hear an alert.
To change the sound of the alert:
1. Go to the Runelite settings and set the Notification Sound to Custom.
2. Place a custom notification.wav file in the %username%/.runelite folder.
